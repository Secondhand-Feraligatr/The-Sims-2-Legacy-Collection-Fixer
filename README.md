- Installs the IKEA Stuff Pack.

- Restores the radio songs cut due to licensing issues.

- Fixes an issue where some of the CAS items from the Happy Holidays Stuff Pack are missing.

- Sets all of the 'Objects.package' files to read only so you can't corrupt them.

- Changes the menus so they just say 'The Sims™ 2'.

- Changes the title screen music and loading text to be the ones from base game.

- Installs dgVoodoo 2 for improved compatibility and performance.

- Installs the 'TS2-Extender' created by [Lazy Duchess](https://www.tumblr.com/lazyduchess).

**Important Notice:** TS2-Extender is still a **work in progress**, and thus the version included in The Sims 2 Legacy Collection Fixer (**0.30**) **may be out of date**.

## **Notes**
- Using the **verfity integrity of game files** option in Steam or EA App will **revert** some of the fixes made by this installer. This happens because it detects the modified game files and replaces them with the vanilla ones. The fixes reverted are the restored radio songs, the 'Objects.package' files being read only, the missing CAS items from the Happy Holidays Stuff Pack, the menues saying 'The Sims™ 2', and the base game loading text. You do can use the program again to fix this issue.

- If you are having issues with dgVoodoo 2 and need to remove it, it's located in TSBin in the EP9 folder. The files you delete are **D3D8.dll**, **D3D9.dll**, **D3DImm.dll**, **DDraw.dll**, **dgVoodoo.conf**, **dgVoodooCpl**.

 - TS2-Extender auto skips the intro and makes the game launch in borderless mode. You can change this by editing the 'TS2Extender.ini' located in TSBin in the EP9 folder.

## **Recommended Mods & Programs**

This is all stuff that isn't included in this program, but I highly recommend you go install.

- [Sims2Pack Clean Installer](https://modthesims.info/d/409950/sims2pack-clean-installer-v1-6-22-updated-aug-2-2014.html) - Legacy Collection doesn't include the Maxis program needed to install 'Sims2Pack' files, so you can use this Mootilda program instead.

- [UI Text Fonts Fix for AL/MG](https://modthesims.info/d/563540) - FIxes an issue where the text is smaller than it should be.

- [Maxis-Match Widescreen CAS Fix](https://modthesims.info/d/681743/maxis-match-widescreen-cas-fix.html) - FIxes an issue where the CAS UI covers your sim when playing on a modern resolution.

- [HoodChecker](https://modthesims.info/d/456523) - Detects and fixes issues with your neighborhoods.

- [No Corrupted Death Memory](http://www.moreawesomethanyou.com/smf/index.php?topic=2368.0) - Fixes an issue where sims can get a corrupted death memory.
