## **Fixes & Improvements**
Installs the IKEA Stuff Pack.

Restores the radio songs cut due to licensing issues.

Fixes an issue where some of the CAS items from the Happy Holidays Stuff Pack are missing.

Sets all of the 'Objects.package' files to read only so you can't corrupt them.

Installs 'dgVoodoo 2' for improved compatibility and performance.

Installs the 'TS2-Extender' created by Lazy Duchess.

**Notice:** TS2-Extender is still a **work in progress**, and thus the version included in The Sims 2 Legacy Collection Fixer (**0.30**) **may be out of date**.

## **Use Instructions**
1. **Download** the installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/releases).  
2. **Run** the `.exe` (obviously).  
3. **Select** the correct game install location (Steam, EA App, or Custom) and then let it install all the files.

## **Important Notes**
If you have already installed the Ikea Stuff Pack to Legacy Collection, then **uninstall** it before using this so it works correctly.

Using the 'verfity integrity of game files' option in Steam or EA App will **revert** some of the fixes made by this installer. This happens because it detects the modified game files and replaces them with the vanilla ones. The fixes reverted are the restored radio songs, the 'Objects.package' files being read only, and the missing CAS items from the Happy Holidays Stuff Pack.
