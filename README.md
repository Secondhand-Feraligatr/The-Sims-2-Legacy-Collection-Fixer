## **Fixes**
Installs the IKEA Stuff Pack.

Restores the radio songs cut due to licensing issues.

Fixes an issue where some of the CAS items from the Happy Holidays Stuff Pack are missing.

Sets all of the 'Objects.package' files to read only so you can't corrupt them.

Installs the TS2-Extender created by Lazy Duchess.

**Notice:** TS2-Extender is still a **work in progress**, and thus the version included in The Sims 2 Legacy Collection Fixer (**0.30**) **may be out of date**.
