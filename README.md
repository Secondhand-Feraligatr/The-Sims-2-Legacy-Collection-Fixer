## **Notes**
- If you have already added the Ikea Stuff Pack to Legacy Collection, then **uninstall** it first so this program works correctly.

- Using the **verfity integrity of game files** option in Steam or EA App will **revert** some of the fixes made by this installer. This happens because it detects the modified game files and replaces them with the vanilla ones. The fixes reverted are the restored radio songs, the 'Objects.package' files being read only, and the missing CAS items from the Happy Holidays Stuff Pack.

- If you are having issues with dgVoodoo 2 and need to remove it, go to your Legacy Collection install and then open 'TSBin' in the 'EP9' folder. The files you delete are **D3D8.dll**, **D3D9.dll**, **D3DImm.dll**, **DDraw.dll**, **dgVoodoo.conf**, **dgVoodooCpl**.
